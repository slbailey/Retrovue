# Legacy / Quarantine Rules

These locations are considered **legacy** or **to be moved**:

```text
src/retrovue/app/
src/retrovue/content_manager/
src/retrovue/schedule_manager/
src_legacy/
Rules
Do not add new code here.

Do not import from these into new code unless it is an explicit migration step.

If existing code still references these modules, prefer to:

Create a new usecase under src/retrovue/usecases/

Update the CLI to call the new usecase

Add/adjust the contract test

Then decommission the legacy module

Temporary moves
If you need to keep old code around, move it under src_legacy/ with the same structure.

New features never go into src_legacy/.
