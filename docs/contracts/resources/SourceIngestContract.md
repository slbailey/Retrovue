# Source Ingest

## Purpose

Defines the exact behavior, safety, idempotence, and data effects of the ingest operation for an entire source. This is an iterative operation that processes all enabled collections within a source, following the same pattern as Source Discover but for asset ingestion rather than collection discovery. All operations must use importers that implement the ImporterInterface correctly. Each collection ingest operates in its own transaction boundary, allowing for partial success when some collections fail.

NOTE: This command operates at the source level and iterates across all enabled collections, processing each collection's ingest operation. Each collection ingest follows the exact same process defined in the Collection Ingest, with each collection operating in its own transaction boundary to allow for partial success when some collections fail.

## Command Shape

**CLI Syntax:**

```
retrovue source ingest <source_id>|"<source name>" [--dry-run] [--test-db] [--json]
```

- `<source_id>`: The UUID or database identifier for the source to ingest
- `"source name"`: Human-friendly, quoted name for the source (alternative to ID)
- `--dry-run`: Show intended ingest actions without modifying the database
- `--test-db`: Direct all actions at the isolated test database environment
- `--json`: Output information in a structured JSON format for automation

**Scope Restrictions:**

- **BULK OPERATION ONLY**: This command operates at the source level and processes ALL enabled collections
- **NO COLLECTION-LEVEL NARROWING**: The command MUST NOT accept or forward any collection-level narrowing flags:
  - `--title`
  - `--season`
  - `--episode`
- **SURGICAL CONTROL**: For targeted ingest of specific titles/seasons/episodes, use `retrovue collection ingest <collection_id> [--title ... --season ... --episode ...]`
- **SINGLE TRANSACTION**: The entire source ingest operation MUST be wrapped in a single Unit of Work, ensuring atomicity across all collections

**Requirements:**

- The command MUST require either a source ID or exact source name
- Named lookup MUST support both human and machine workflows
- The command MUST iterate over all collections where `sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true` for the specified source

---

## Safety Expectations

- The command MUST refuse to run against a source that has no collections where `sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`
- The command MUST verify that the source exists and is accessible before attempting collection iteration
- **COLLECTION-LEVEL NARROWING FORBIDDEN**: If any collection-level narrowing flags (`--title`, `--season`, `--episode`) are provided, the CLI MUST refuse to run, exit with code 1, and emit a human-readable error directing the operator to use `retrovue collection ingest`
- If `--dry-run` is provided, the command MUST NOT make any database or persistent state changes, but MUST show what _would_ be ingested across all collections
- If `--test-db` is provided, the command MUST operate solely on an isolated, non-production database
- Partial or failed ingest operations across collections MUST NOT result in orphaned or incomplete database records
- **SINGLE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY**: The entire source ingest operation MUST be wrapped in a single Unit of Work. If any collection ingest fails fatally, the entire source ingest operation MUST be rolled back. Non-fatal collection ingest failures (e.g., individual asset processing errors) MUST be logged but MUST NOT abort the entire operation.
- Source's importer must be interface compliant (ImporterInterface). Implementations that subclass BaseImporter are considered compliant by construction. Non-compliant importers MUST cause the command to fail with exit code 1.
- Asset ingestion MUST use importer's enumeration capability for content discovery
- Interface compliance MUST be verified before ingest attempt

---

## Output Format

### Human-Readable Output

- Source identification and summary
- Total number of eligible collections found (`sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`)
- Per-collection ingest results:
  - Collection name and status
  - Assets discovered, ingested, skipped, updated per collection
  - Last ingest time per collection
- Overall summary with total counts across all collections:
  - Total assets discovered, ingested, skipped, updated
  - Total duplicates prevented
  - Overall last ingest time
- Summary line with clear status: `Success`, `Partial Success`, `Error: No eligible collections`, etc.
- EXAMPLE: Source ingest complete: 4 collections processed, 1,250 assets discovered (800 ingested, 400 skipped, 50 updated)

### JSON Output (if `--json` is provided)

- Top-level deterministic keys:
  - `"status"`: `"success"` | `"partial"` | `"error"`
  - `"source"`: Source identification object
  - `"collections_processed"`: Number of collections processed
  - `"stats"`: Aggregated statistics object:
    - `"assets_discovered"`: Total assets discovered across all collections
    - `"assets_ingested"`: Total assets ingested across all collections
    - `"assets_skipped"`: Total assets skipped across all collections
    - `"assets_updated"`: Total assets updated across all collections
    - `"duplicates_prevented"`: Total duplicates prevented across all collections
  - `"last_ingest_time"`: Overall last ingest time (ISO format)
  - `"collection_results"`: [array of per-collection result objects matching CollectionIngest format]
  - `"errors"`: [array of error objects/messages]
- Must include all the information from the human-readable output in a machine-consumable way.

---

## Exit Codes

- `0` — Success; all collections ingested successfully or (if `--dry-run`) actions listed with no errors.
- `1` — Validation failure (e.g., source not found, no enabled collections, mapping invalid).
- `2` — Partial success; some collections succeeded, some failed.
- `3` — External system unreachable (source location cannot be accessed).
- All non-zero exit codes MUST be accompanied by a clear error message in both human and JSON output.

---

## Data Effects

- **SINGLE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY**: The entire source ingest operation MUST be wrapped in a single Unit of Work, ensuring atomicity across all collections. If any collection ingest fails fatally, the entire source ingest operation MUST be rolled back.
- For each eligible collection (`sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`), the ingest process follows the exact same rules as defined in the [Collection Ingest](CollectionIngestContract.md).
- New Assets MUST be created with state = `new` and MUST NOT be in `ready` state at creation time. If enrichers are attached to the collection, assets MAY transition through `enriching` state during active enrichment processing, but MUST NOT remain in `enriching` state after enrichment completes.
- Duplicate detection logic MUST prevent the creation of duplicate Asset records within each collection, following the Collection Ingest contract rules.
- Any enrichment hooks MAY run during ingest per collection, following the same per-asset failure handling.
- Assets created by this operation MUST NOT be marked as approved for broadcast automatically.
- Individual collection ingest failures (non-fatal, e.g., individual asset processing errors) MUST be logged but MUST NOT abort the entire source ingest operation.
- The source ingest operation MUST aggregate and report statistics from all collection ingests, including total assets discovered, ingested, skipped, updated, and duplicates prevented.
- The source ingest operation MUST report the overall last ingest time (the latest `last_ingest_time` across all successfully processed collections).

## Behavior Contract

#### Behavior Contract Rules (B-#)

- **B-1:** The command MUST accept `<source_id>` as any of: full UUID, external ID (e.g. Plex server key), or case-insensitive display name. Source name matching MUST be case-insensitive. If multiple sources match the provided name (case-insensitive), the command MUST exit with code 1 and emit: "Multiple sources named '<name>' exist. Please specify the UUID." Resolution MUST NOT prefer one source over another, even if one has exact casing match.
- **B-2:** The command MUST iterate ingest across all collections belonging to `<source_id>` that are both `sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`.
- **B-3:** The command MUST NOT accept or forward any of the collection-level narrowing flags: `--title`, `--season`, `--episode`.
- **B-4:** If any collection-level narrowing flags (`--title`, `--season`, `--episode`) are provided, the CLI MUST refuse to run, exit with code 1, and emit the error message: "Per-title/season/episode ingest is only supported at the collection level. Use: retrovue collection ingest <collection_id> [--title ... --season ... --episode ...]"
- **B-5:** Source ingest MUST clearly summarize, in human-readable output and in `--json` mode, which collections were targeted and which were skipped (and why). Partial failures are allowed and MUST produce exit code 2.
- **B-6:** When run with `--dry-run`, the command MUST enumerate what would be ingested for each eligible collection but MUST NOT call actual ingest routines that mutate data.
- **B-7:** Output with `--json` MUST include `"status": "success" | "partial" | "error"` and explicit per-collection results matching CollectionIngest format.
- **B-8:** When run with `--test-db`, no changes may affect production or staging databases.
- **B-9:** When both `--dry-run` and `--test-db` are provided, `--dry-run` takes precedence. The command MUST NOT write to any database (neither production nor test), but MUST still use the test DB context for resolution and validation.
- **B-10:** **SINGLE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY**: The entire source ingest operation MUST be wrapped in a single Unit of Work. If any collection ingest fails fatally, the entire source ingest operation MUST be rolled back. Non-fatal collection ingest failures (e.g., individual asset processing errors) MUST be logged but MUST NOT abort the entire operation.
- **B-11:** For each eligible collection, the system MUST call the importer's `validate_ingestible()` method BEFORE calling `enumerate_assets()` or any other ingest work. If `validate_ingestible()` returns `false`, the collection MUST be skipped and logged.
- **B-12:** Source's importer must be interface compliant (ImporterInterface). Implementations that subclass BaseImporter are considered compliant by construction. Non-compliant importers MUST cause the command to fail with exit code 1.
- **B-13:** Interface compliance MUST be verified before ingest attempt.
- **B-14:** The command MUST aggregate statistics from all collection ingests and report totals for assets discovered, ingested, skipped, updated, and duplicates prevented.
- **B-15:** The command MUST report the overall last ingest time (the latest `last_ingest_time` across all successfully processed collections).

---

### Data Contract

#### Data Contract Rules (D-#)

- **D-1:** **SINGLE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY**: The entire source ingest operation MUST be wrapped in a single Unit of Work, following Unit of Work principles. If a fatal error occurs before successful completion, no assets, relationships, or side effects from any collection ingest may persist.
- **D-2:** Source ingest MUST only process collections where `sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`. Collections that do not meet both criteria MUST be skipped and logged.
- **D-3:** For each eligible collection, the system MUST call the importer's `validate_ingestible()` method BEFORE calling `enumerate_assets()` or any other ingest work. If `validate_ingestible()` returns `false`, the collection MUST be skipped and logged.
- **D-4:** Source ingest MUST invoke the same underlying ingestion pipeline that collection ingest uses for "full collection" mode (no `--title`/`--season`/`--episode`), but MUST call it in "full collection" scope only.
- **D-5:** All ingest operations triggered under source ingest MUST be tracked individually per collection in ingest logs/audit trails, distinguishing between bulk source ingest and manual surgical ingest.
- **D-6:** Duplicate detection logic MUST prevent the creation of duplicate Asset records within each collection, following the Collection Ingest contract rules.
- **D-7:** Every new Asset MUST begin in lifecycle state `new` and MUST NOT be in `ready` state at creation time. If enrichers are attached to the collection, assets MAY transition through `enriching` state during active enrichment processing, but MUST NOT remain in `enriching` state after enrichment completes.
- **D-8:** Importer interface compliance MUST be verified before ingest attempt.
- **D-9:** Asset discovery MUST use the importer's enumeration capability to retrieve the assets belonging to that collection, in full-collection mode. The importer's `enumerate_assets()` method MUST return normalized asset descriptions (normalized Asset data) and MUST NOT perform any database writes or persistence operations.
- **D-10:** Importers MUST NOT directly persist to authoritative database tables. All database persistence (Asset creation, updates, collection state updates) MUST be performed by the ingest service layer within Unit of Work transaction boundaries. The service layer receives normalized asset data from the importer and is responsible for all database operations.
- **D-11:** The `ingestible` field MUST be validated by calling the importer's `validate_ingestible()` method before ingesting each collection.
- **D-12:** If `ingestible=false`, the collection MUST NOT be included in bulk ingest operations, even if `sync_enabled=true`.
- **D-13:** All operations run with `--test-db` MUST be isolated from production database storage, tables, and triggers.
- **D-14:** When both `--dry-run` and `--test-db` are provided, `--dry-run` takes precedence. The command MUST NOT write to any database (neither production nor test), but MUST still use the test DB context for resolution and validation.
- **D-15:** Source-level ingest MUST NOT create any source-level database records; all persistence occurs at the collection level.
- **D-16:** The source ingest operation MUST aggregate and report statistics from all collection ingests, including total assets discovered, ingested, skipped, updated, and duplicates prevented.
- **D-17:** The source ingest operation MUST report the overall last ingest time (the latest `last_ingest_time` across all successfully processed collections).

---

## Test Coverage Mapping

- **B-1..B-15** → `test_source_ingest_contract.py`
- **D-1..D-17** → `test_source_ingest_data_contract.py`
- **D-9, D-10** → `test_source_ingest_data_contract.py` (importer/service separation)

Each rule above MUST have explicit test coverage in its respective test file, following the contract test responsibilities in [README.md](./README.md).  
Each test file MUST reference these rule IDs in docstrings or comments to provide bidirectional traceability.

Future related tests (integration or scenario-level) MAY reference these same rule IDs for coverage mapping but must not redefine behavior.

## Examples

### Valid Source Ingest Operations

```bash
# Ingest all enabled collections from a source
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server"

# Ingest with JSON output
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --json

# Dry-run source ingest
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --dry-run

# Test source ingest
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --test-db --dry-run
```

### Forbidden Operations (Will Fail)

```bash
# FORBIDDEN: Collection-level narrowing flags
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --title "The Big Bang Theory"
# Error: Per-title/season/episode ingest is only supported at the collection level.
# Use: retrovue collection ingest <collection_id> [--title ... --season ... --episode ...]

# FORBIDDEN: Season flag
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --season 1
# Error: Per-title/season/episode ingest is only supported at the collection level.

# FORBIDDEN: Episode flag
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --episode 6
# Error: Per-title/season/episode ingest is only supported at the collection level.
```

### Correct Surgical Operations

```bash
# For targeted ingest, use collection ingest instead
retrovue collection ingest "TV Shows" --title "The Big Bang Theory"
retrovue collection ingest "TV Shows" --title "The Big Bang Theory" --season 1
retrovue collection ingest "TV Shows" --title "The Big Bang Theory" --season 1 --episode 6
```

## Relationship to Collection Ingest

This Source Ingest builds upon and orchestrates the Collection Ingest:

- **Iteration**: Source ingest iterates across all eligible collections (`sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`), similar to Source Discover
- **Unit of Work**: The entire source ingest operation is wrapped in a single Unit of Work, ensuring atomicity across all collections
- **Atomicity**: All collection ingests occur within the same transaction boundary. If any collection ingest fails fatally, the entire source ingest operation is rolled back
- **Error Handling**: Fatal collection ingest failures abort the entire operation; non-fatal failures (e.g., individual asset processing errors) are logged but don't abort
- **Aggregation**: Source ingest aggregates results from multiple collection ingests into a unified output with total statistics
- **Safety**: Source ingest maintains the same safety guarantees as collection ingest, applied across all collections atomically
- **Validation**: Source ingest enforces the same validation order as collection ingest: collection resolution → prerequisite validation → scope resolution

All collection-level behavior, safety expectations, and data effects are inherited from the Collection Ingest and MUST be enforced for each collection processed by the source ingest operation.

---

## Examples

### Basic Source Ingest

```bash
# Ingest all enabled collections from a source
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server"

# Ingest by source ID
retrovue source ingest plex-5063d926

# Ingest with JSON output
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --json
```

### Dry-run Testing

```bash
# Preview ingest across all collections
retrovue source ingest "My Plex Server" --dry-run

# Test ingest logic
retrovue source ingest "Test Source" --test-db --dry-run
```

### Test Environment Usage

```bash
# Test source ingest in isolated environment
retrovue source ingest "Test Plex Server" --test-db
```

---

## Safety Guidelines

- Always use `--test-db` for testing source ingest logic
- Use `--dry-run` to preview ingest actions across all collections
- Verify source configuration and enabled collections before ingest
- Monitor per-collection results for partial failures
- Confirm source identification before ingest
