# Source ↔ Collection Cross-Domain Guarantees

## Overview

This document defines the guarantees and constraints that govern interactions between the Source domain and the Collection domain. These guarantees ensure that source operations, collection discovery, and lifecycle management maintain consistency when sources manage collections.

The Source-Collection relationship is critical because:

- Sources define content ingestion pipelines that discover and manage collections
- Collections represent logical groupings of content within sources
- Both domains must coordinate for successful content discovery and ingestion
- Collection lifecycle must be synchronized with source lifecycle

### Interaction Summary

The lifecycle of Source-Collection operations follows this pattern:

1. **User runs `retrovue source add --discover`** → Command parsing and validation
2. **Source domain creates Source entity** → Source persistence with transaction boundary
3. **Source invokes Collection discovery service** → Collection enumeration via importer
4. **Collection domain persists discovered collections** → Collections created with `enabled=False` by default
5. **Source commits transaction** → Atomic completion of source and collection creation

This flow ensures that source operations maintain consistency with collection state while providing clear orchestration boundaries between domains.

## Participating Domains

### Source Domain

- **Contract:** `docs/contracts/resources/SourceAddContract.md`, `docs/contracts/resources/SourceDiscoverContract.md`, `docs/contracts/resources/SourceIngestContract.md`
- **Interface:** Source creation, discovery, and ingestion operations
- **Responsibilities:** Source persistence, collection discovery, external ID generation

### Collection Domain

- **Contract:** `docs/contracts/CollectionContract.md`, `docs/contracts/resources/CollectionIngestContract.md`
- **Interface:** Collection management, ingestion, and lifecycle operations
- **Responsibilities:** Collection persistence, ingestibility validation, sync management

---

## Cross-Domain Guarantees

### G-1: Collection Discovery Coordination

**Collection discovery MUST be coordinated between Source and Collection domains.**

- Source discovery operations MUST create Collection records with proper domain mapping
- Collection discovery MUST occur within the same transaction as source operations when using `--discover`
- Newly discovered collections MUST be persisted with `enabled=False` by default
- Collection external IDs MUST be unique within the source context

### G-2: Collection Lifecycle Synchronization

**Collection lifecycle MUST be synchronized with source lifecycle.**

- Source deletion MUST handle collection cleanup appropriately
- Source updates MUST validate collection compatibility changes
- Collection updates MUST not break existing source configurations
- Lifecycle coordination MUST maintain referential integrity

### G-3: Collection Ingestibility Validation

**Collection ingestibility MUST be validated before source ingestion operations.**

- Source ingestion MUST only operate on collections with `sync_enabled=true` AND `ingestible=true`
- Collection ingestibility MUST be re-validated before each ingestion operation
- Invalid collection states MUST cause source ingestion to fail with appropriate error codes
- CLI MUST emit clear error message: "Error: Collection '{name}' is not ingestible"

### G-4: Transactional Integrity

**Collection operations MUST maintain transactional integrity with source operations.**

- Collection discovery and source creation MUST occur within a single transaction boundary
- Collection ingestion and source ingestion MUST maintain atomicity per collection
- Any failure in collection operations MUST roll back appropriately
- Transaction rollback MUST be atomic and complete

### G-5: Collection State Consistency

**Collection state MUST remain consistent across source operations.**

- Collection state changes MUST be persisted atomically
- Collection state MUST be validated before source operations
- State inconsistencies MUST be detected and reported
- System state MUST remain consistent after any failure

### G-6: Collection Path Mapping Coordination

**Collection path mappings MUST be coordinated between domains.**

- Each newly discovered Collection MUST create a corresponding PathMapping record with local_path=NULL until explicitly resolved
- Path mappings MUST be created for all discovered collections
- Updates to PathMapping MUST remain synchronized with Collection state transitions (enabled, ingestible, sync_enabled)
- Path mapping consistency MUST be maintained across operations

## Failure & Rollback Policy

### Transaction Failure Handling

1. **Discovery Failure**: Source creation MUST fail immediately with exit code 1
2. **Collection Failure**: Collection operations MUST fail with appropriate error codes
3. **Ingestibility Failure**: Source ingestion MUST fail with exit code 1
4. **State Failure**: Operations MUST fail with exit code 1
5. **Database Failure**: All pending changes MUST be rolled back atomically

### Partial Failure Prevention

- **Per-Collection Atomicity**: Each collection operation MUST be atomic
- **Source-Level Orchestration**: Source operations MUST handle partial collection failures gracefully
- **Atomic Rollback**: Database rollback MUST be complete and immediate
- **State Consistency**: System state MUST remain consistent after any failure

### Error Message Standards

- **Discovery Errors**: "Error: Failed to discover collections from source '{name}'"
- **Ingestibility Errors**: "Error: Collection '{name}' is not ingestible"
- **State Errors**: "Error: Collection '{name}' is in invalid state"
- **System Errors**: "Error: {operation} failed: {specific_error_message}"

### Exit Code Semantics

| Exit Code | Meaning         | Example Scenario                                        |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Success         | All collections discovered/ingested successfully        |
| 1         | Failure         | Discovery error, ingestibility error, or system failure |
| 2         | Partial success | Some collections succeeded, others failed               |

## Versioning & Change Coordination

### Version Coordination

- **Minor Changes**: Source and Collection contracts may bump minor versions independently
- **Major Changes**: Cross-domain guarantee changes require coordination between domains
- **Breaking Changes**: Must be coordinated across all participating domains

### Change Process

1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate impact on cross-domain guarantees
2. **Contract Updates**: Update relevant domain contracts
3. **Guarantee Updates**: Update this cross-domain guarantee document
4. **Test Updates**: Update cross-domain test suite
5. **Migration**: Update `CONTRACT_MIGRATION.md` status

### Backward Compatibility

- **Interface Stability**: Cross-domain interfaces MUST maintain backward compatibility
- **Schema Evolution**: Collection schemas MUST support backward-compatible evolution
- **Migration Path**: Breaking changes MUST provide clear migration paths

## Examples

### Valid Source Creation with Collection Discovery

```bash
# Valid: Source creation with collection discovery
retrovue source add --type plex --name "My Plex" \
  --base-url "http://plex:32400" --token "token" \
  --discover
# Success: Source created, collections discovered and persisted with enabled=False
```

### Valid Source Ingestion with Enabled Collections

```bash
# Valid: Source ingestion with enabled collections
retrovue source ingest "My Plex"
# Success: Only collections with sync_enabled=true AND ingestible=true are processed
```

### Invalid Collection State

```bash
# Invalid: Collection not ingestible
retrovue source ingest "My Plex"
# Exit code: 1
# Error: Collection 'Movies' is not ingestible
```

### Collection Discovery Failure

```bash
# Invalid: Collection discovery fails
retrovue source add --type plex --name "My Plex" \
  --base-url "http://plex:32400" --token "token" \
  --discover
# Exit code: 1
# Error: Failed to discover collections from source 'My Plex'
```

### Partial Collection Ingestion Failure

```bash
# Partial: Some collections fail, others succeed
retrovue source ingest "My Plex"
# Exit code: 2 (partial success)
# Success: Collections 'Movies', 'TV Shows' ingested
# Failed: Collection 'Music' failed ingestion
```
