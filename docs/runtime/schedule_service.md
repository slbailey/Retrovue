# RetroVue Runtime — ScheduleService

> Station's programming authority for "what should air, and when."

**Note:** This document consolidates content from multiple earlier sources (docs/components/_ and docs/runtime/_) as part of documentation unification (2025-10-24).

## Purpose

ScheduleService is the station's programming authority for "what should air, and when."

All other runtime components (ChannelManager, ProgramDirector, AsRunLogger, the future guide, etc.) rely on it for schedule interpretation.

ScheduleService owns broadcast day logic and channel timing policy. No other component may redefine or guess these rules.

## Content Authority Constraint

**ScheduleService may only schedule assets that Content Manager has marked as canonical/approved for broadcast.**

ScheduleService is forbidden from:

- Fetching raw content directly from Plex, filesystem, or unreviewed sources
- Scheduling unapproved or non-canonical content
- Bypassing Content Manager for content decisions

If no approved content exists for a slot, this is a scheduling failure. ChannelManager must not improvise replacement content.

## Broadcast Day Model (6:00 → 6:00 local)

Each channel has a broadcast day that does not run midnight→midnight.

The broadcast day starts at a channel-specific rollover minute after local midnight (default: 6:00am local, i.e. 360 minutes).

The broadcast day ends just before the next day's rollover.

At 2:00am local, you may still be in "yesterday's" broadcast day.

At 5:30am local, you're still in the previous broadcast day.

At 6:15am local, you're in the new broadcast day.

**Broadcast day is an accounting/reporting construct for station operations.**

**It is NOT a hard playout cut point.**

### ScheduleService Methods

#### `broadcast_day_for(channel_id, when_utc) -> date`

Given a UTC timestamp, return the broadcast day label (a date) for that channel.

**Steps:**

1. Convert when_utc (aware datetime in UTC) to channel-local using MasterClock.to_channel_time()
2. If local_time.time() >= 06:00, broadcast day label is local_time.date()
3. Else, broadcast day label is (local_time.date() - 1 day)
4. Return that label as a date object

#### `broadcast_day_window(channel_id, when_utc) -> tuple[datetime, datetime]`

Return (start_local, end_local) for the broadcast day that contains when_utc, in channel-local tz, tz-aware datetimes.

- start_local = YYYY-MM-DD 06:00:00
- end_local = (YYYY-MM-DD+1) 05:59:59.999999

#### `active_segment_spanning_rollover(channel_id, rollover_start_utc)`

Given the UTC timestamp for rollover boundary (which is local 06:00:00), return info about any scheduled content that STARTED BEFORE rollover and CONTINUES AFTER rollover.

**Returns:**

- None if nothing is carrying over
- Otherwise return a dict with:
  - program_id: identifier/title/asset ref
  - absolute_start_utc: aware UTC datetime
  - absolute_end_utc: aware UTC datetime
  - carryover_start_local: tz-aware local datetime at rollover start
  - carryover_end_local: tz-aware local datetime when the asset actually ends

### Rollover Handling

A broadcast day schedule may legally include an item whose end is AFTER the 06:00 turnover, if it began before 06:00. The next broadcast day must treat that carried segment as already in progress; it cannot schedule new content under it until it finishes.

**Example: HBO Movie 05:00–07:00**

- Movie starts at 05:00 local (Day A)
- Movie continues past 06:00 rollover
- Movie ends at 07:00 local (Day B)
- Day B's schedule must account for 06:00–07:00 being occupied by carryover

**When building the next broadcast day, ScheduleService must honor rollover carryover. If the previous day's programming continues past rollover, the new broadcast day does not start scheduling fresh content until that carryover ends.**

**Example: If rollover is 06:00 but a movie runs to 07:00, the first schedulable slot for the new day is 07:00, not 06:00.**

This maintains broadcast discipline and prevents double-scheduling conflicts.

## Critical Rules

**ChannelManager never snaps playback at 06:00.**

**AsRunLogger may split one continuous asset across two broadcast days in reporting. That's expected, not an error.**

## Implementation Notes

- All APIs ALWAYS accept or return tz-aware datetimes
- If something naive is passed in, raise ValueError
- These APIs MUST use MasterClock for timezone conversion
- No direct datetime.now() or manual tz math is allowed
- Use the already-implemented MasterClock.to_channel_time()

### Channel Timing Policy

Each channel carries its own timing policy configuration:

- **timezone**: IANA timezone string (e.g. "America/New_York"). Used with MasterClock for all conversions.
- **grid_slot_size_minutes**: Natural planning granularity.
  - Examples:
    - 30 for traditional half-hour grids
    - 15 for movie channels that align promos around film starts/ends
    - 60 for pure longform channels
- **grid_slot_offset_minutes**: Offset from the top of the hour that this channel uses for "starts."
  - Examples:
    - 0 means :00/:30
    - 5 means :05/:35 (classic TBS-style)
- **broadcast_day_rollover_minutes_local**: Minute after local midnight when a new broadcast day begins for that channel.
  - Default: 360 (6:00am).
  - Could be 365 (6:05am), 300 (5:00am), etc.

ScheduleService is responsible for honoring these policies when generating future schedule blocks and playout segments.

No other component should assume "programs always start on :00/:30" or "broadcast day always rolls at 6:00am."

In v0.1, most channels will likely use:

- grid_slot_size_minutes = 30
- grid_slot_offset_minutes = 0
- broadcast_day_rollover_minutes_local = 360

But the design and interfaces assume per-channel flexibility so we don't have to redesign later.

## Horizon Generation (Scheduler Daemon)

RetroVue maintains a forward "horizon" of scheduled segments for continuous broadcast operations.

- **Near-term horizon** (for ChannelManager playout): precise, second-accurate playout plan for the next ~1–2 hours.
- **Longer horizon** (for preview / guide / UI): higher-level programming blocks for the next several hours or next day(s).

A background loop (scheduler_daemon / horizon builder) keeps these horizons generated.

### Loop Contract

1. Ask MasterClock.now_utc() for the current authoritative time.
2. For each channel, ask ScheduleService:
   - "Based on this channel's timing policy and broadcast day rollover rules, what's supposed to air next?"
   - "Do we already have scheduled segments covering from now out to the target horizon window?"
   - "If not, generate more future segments."
3. Persist/emit those segments for runtime.

**MasterClock remains passive. It does not fire callbacks or timers. The scheduler_daemon polls MasterClock for time instead of registering 'wake me at 06:00' listeners.**

**ScheduleService never calls datetime.now() directly. It always works from explicit timestamps provided by the daemon, which come from MasterClock.**

## ScheduledSegment Model

ScheduledSegment represents what ScheduleService emits for downstream consumers:

```python
ScheduledSegment:
    channel_id: str
    program_id: str
    title: str

    start_utc: datetime (tz-aware UTC)
    end_utc: datetime (tz-aware UTC)

    start_local: datetime (tz-aware, channel-local)
    end_local: datetime (tz-aware, channel-local)

    broadcast_day_label: date
        - Result of broadcast_day_for(channel_id, start_utc)
        - Used by reporting, compliance, "what aired on Thursday"

    is_continuation: bool
        - True if this segment began before the current planning window or
          continues across a broadcast day rollover
```

- ChannelManager consumes these ScheduledSegments to know what to play now and how far into it we are.
- AsRunLogger uses them for logging actual air events (including splitting at broadcast day boundaries for reporting).
- The future Prevue-style guide channel will consume them to render "what's on now / next," but its visual 30-minute buckets are just presentation. Those 30-minute buckets are NOT written back into the schedule model.

**There is no stored "30-minute grid row" in the authoritative schedule. The 30-minute row is a presentation trick for the guide UI, not a scheduling primitive.**

## Testing

Use the `retrovue test broadcast-day-alignment` command to validate broadcast day logic and rollover handling. This test validates the HBO-style 05:00–07:00 scenario and ensures proper broadcast day classification.
