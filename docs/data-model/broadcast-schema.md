# RetroVue Broadcast Data Model

> This document describes the Broadcast Domain tables that control channel policy, scheduling, and playout.
> These tables are managed through operator tools and are consumed by ScheduleService and runtime playout.
> They are separate from Library Domain tables (episodes, assets, provider_refs, review_queue, seasons, titles, etc.).

These tables live in Postgres and are created by Alembic migrations. Runtime code is forbidden from altering core configuration tables.

**Critical Rule**: The tables `channels`, `templates`, `template_blocks`, `schedule_days`, and `playlog_events` have been removed. They were replaced by the Broadcast Domain tables and must not be reintroduced.

## Conventions

- **timestamptz columns** are station audit timestamps, default NOW() on write.
- **"broadcast day"** refers to the 06:00 → 06:00 programming day (rollover_minutes).
- **"canonical"** means "approved for air".

## Tables

### channel

Defines channel timing policy and operational parameters. Each channel represents a broadcast stream with its own schedule, timezone, and grid configuration.

### template

Programming templates that define daypart rules and content selection criteria. Templates are reusable scheduling patterns.

### schedule_day

Assigns a template to a channel for a specific broadcast day. Each channel can have exactly one template per broadcast day.

| Column        | Type        | Description                                                                          | Required? | Who writes it                       | Who reads it     |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |

**Constraints:**

- Unique constraint on (channel_id, schedule_date) ensures one template per channel per broadcast day

### Asset (from Library Domain)

Broadcast-approved assets that are eligible for scheduling. Assets from the Library Domain can be scheduled when `state='ready'` and `approved_for_broadcast=true`. The Asset table serves as the single source of truth for schedulable content.

| Column                 | Type        | Description                                                               | Required? | Who writes it                       | Who reads it                                             |

| canonical              | BOOLEAN     | Approval status - only canonical=true entries are eligible for scheduling | Yes       | retrovue CLI / infra.admin_services | ScheduleService, runtime/ChannelManager                  |
| source_ingest_asset_id | INTEGER     | Link to Library Domain asset for provenance/audit                         | No        | retrovue CLI / infra.admin_services | Audit, reporting                                         |
| created_at             | TIMESTAMPTZ | Creation timestamp                                                        | Yes       | Database                            | Audit, reporting                                         |

**Indexes:**

- Index on canonical for ScheduleService filtering
- Index on tags for rule matching

> **Future integration:**  
> Path resolution from ingest (Plex) source paths to local playout paths is currently performed implicitly.  
> A `path_mapping` table will be introduced to manage library-level mappings (`root_path` → `local_path`) and enforce `file_path` validity during promotion.  
> Until this is implemented, operators must ensure that promoted assets reference locally playable files.

### playlog_event

Generated playout events that record what actually aired. This is the authoritative source of truth for as-run logs and compliance evidence.

**Key Invariants:**

- Each channel has policy (timezone, grid, rollover).
- Each broadcast day for a channel is assigned exactly one template.
- Each template is broken into time blocks with rule_json.
- rule_json selects from the broadcast catalog (catalog_asset) using tags.
- Only canonical=true catalog entries are eligible.
- playlog_event is authoritative for "what aired / is airing / will air."

## Authority and Mutability

### Configuration Tables (channel, template, template_block, schedule_day, catalog_asset)

**Authority:** retrovue CLI / infra.admin_services  
**Runtime Access:** Read-only  
**Audit Status:** Station configuration

These tables are operator-configurable and must not be modified by runtime code. They represent station policy and broadcast catalog curation. Runtime components are forbidden from altering these tables.

### Playlog Table (playlog_event)

**Authority:** ScheduleService  
**Runtime Access:** Read-only  
**Audit Status:** As-run source of truth

This table is generated by ScheduleService and consumed by runtime components. ChannelManager must never invent rows here. CLI modification is restricted to debugging and forensics only.

### Canonical Gating Rules

- **ScheduleService is forbidden** to schedule any catalog_asset where canonical=false.
- **ChannelManager is forbidden** to playout any catalog_asset where canonical=false.
- **Promotion into the broadcast catalog** is an explicit operator act via `retrovue assets promote`.

The canonical flag serves as the approval gate between Library Domain inventory and broadcast scheduling. Only explicit operator approval makes content eligible for air.

## Promotion Workflow: Library → Broadcast Catalog

The Library Domain discovers, ingests, enriches, and reviews media. Once an operator decides "this can air," they run `retrovue assets promote`. Promotion writes a new row into `catalog_asset` in the Broadcast Domain. That row includes:

- title (guide-facing)
- duration_ms (used by scheduler math)
- tags (used to satisfy template_block rule_json)
- file_path (what ChannelManager will actually playout)
- canonical (if true, it's allowed on air)
- source_ingest_asset_id (for provenance / audit)

After promotion, ScheduleService may consider that CatalogAsset when filling a schedule block. If canonical=false, it's visible to operators but still forbidden to air.

**Critical Rules:**

- **ScheduleService is forbidden** to schedule any CatalogAsset with canonical=false.
- **Runtime / ChannelManager is forbidden** to playout any CatalogAsset with canonical=false.
