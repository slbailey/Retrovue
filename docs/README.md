# RetroVue documentation index

RetroVue simulates a 24/7 linear TV network using scheduled content, playout logic, branding, and live ffmpeg output â€” but only spins real video when someone is actually watching.

This directory is organized by audience and layer.

## Architecture

High-level mental model of the system.

- [Architecture overview](architecture/ArchitectureOverview.md)
- [Data flow](architecture/DataFlow.md)
- [System boundaries](architecture/SystemBoundaries.md)

## Domain models

Core concepts RetroVue is built on. These define what the system is, not how it runs.

- [Source](domain/Source.md)
- [Enricher](domain/Enricher.md)
- [Playout pipeline](domain/PlayoutPipeline.md)
- [Broadcast channel](domain/BroadcastChannel.md)
- (Scheduling / EPG / Playlog docs also belong here)

## Runtime

How RetroVue behaves at runtime. ChannelManager, ffmpeg lifecycle, timing.

- [Channel manager](runtime/ChannelManager.md)
- [Producer lifecycle](runtime/ProducerLifecycle.md)
- [Master clock](runtime/MasterClock.md)
- [As-run logging](runtime/AsRunLogging.md)

## Operator
