# üì∫ Retrovue - Retro IPTV Simulation Project

## üé¨ What is Retrovue?

Retrovue is a **retro-inspired IPTV simulation system** designed to recreate the authentic experience of scheduled broadcast television. It is built on a **media-first foundation** where everything begins with a physical media file, and rich metadata is layered on top to create a comprehensive broadcast TV experience.

### **Media-First Architecture**
Retrovue's core philosophy centers around the **media-first approach**:
- **Physical Foundation**: Every piece of content must have an actual playable media file as its foundation
- **Logical Wrappers**: Content items (movies, episodes, bumpers, commercials, etc.) are logical wrappers around media files
- **Metadata Layering**: Rich metadata is layered on top of the media file without modifying the original
- **Playback Guarantee**: Every scheduled item can be played because it has a verified media file

### **Plex-First Integration**
Retrovue is designed with **Plex Media Server integration** as the primary content source:
- **Seamless Import**: Automatically syncs your existing Plex library with episode-level granularity
- **Smart Synchronization**: Only updates content that has actually changed for optimal performance
- **Path Mapping**: Translates Plex internal paths to accessible local file paths
- **Multi-Server Support**: Manage multiple Plex servers from one Retrovue installation

### **Network-Grade IPTV System**
Retrovue functions as a **network-grade IPTV system** that simulates a realistic broadcast TV station experience. Think of it as your own personal cable TV network that can serve multiple viewers simultaneously with professional-grade features and reliability.

### The Big Picture

Instead of just watching your media files one at a time, Retrovue creates **24/7 TV channels** that:
- Play your movies and TV shows on a schedule
- Insert commercials and station bumpers
- Run multiple channels simultaneously (like real cable TV)
- Stream to any device that can play IPTV (VLC, Plex, smart TVs, etc.)

## üéØ What Makes This Special?

### Real TV Station Experience
- **Multiple Channels**: Run several TV channels at once, each with its own schedule
- **Professional Timing**: Proper transitions, commercial breaks, and station IDs
- **Live Streaming**: Continuous 24/7 operation with HLS streaming
- **Emergency Overrides**: Break into programming with alerts or announcements

### Smart Content Management
- **Plex Integration**: Automatically imports your existing Plex library with episode-level granularity
- **Smart Sync**: Only updates content that has actually changed (super fast!)
- **Episode-Level Control**: Each TV episode is managed separately for precise scheduling
- **Metadata Storage**: Tracks everything you need for professional scheduling
- **Path Mapping**: Translates Plex internal paths to accessible local file paths
- **Multi-Server Support**: Manage multiple Plex servers from one installation

### Advanced Metadata Management
- **Editorial Overrides**: Customize metadata without overwriting source data from Plex
- **Namespaced Tagging**: Organize content with structured tags like `audience:kids`, `holiday:christmas`, `brand:fast_food`
- **Parental Controls**: MPAA/TV ratings system with daypart restrictions
- **Content Classification**: Flexible tagging system for audience targeting, seasonal content, and brand management
