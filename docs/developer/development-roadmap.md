## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### **Why Multi-Channel First?**

1. **Core IPTV functionality** - Multiple channels are essential for IPTV
2. **Resource efficiency** - Better resource utilization across channels
3. **User experience** - More realistic TV experience
4. **Foundation for scheduling** - Enables advanced scheduling features

### **Multi-Channel Architecture**

```
Content Library → Channel Manager → Multiple FFmpeg Processes → MPEG-TS Streams → Network
       ↑              ↑                    ↑                      ↑           ↑
   Schedules      Channel State    Video Processing (per channel)  Streams   Clients
```

### **Component Dependencies**

- **Channel Management** ← Independent (can build first)
- **Multi-Channel Streaming** ← Depends on Channel Management
- **Resource Management** ← Depends on Multi-Channel Streaming
- **Scheduling System** ← Depends on Resource Management
- **Commercial Insertion** ← Depends on Scheduling System
- **EPG/Guide Data** ← Depends on Scheduling System

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Phase 4 Completion Criteria (Multi-Channel Support)**

- [ ] Multiple simultaneous channels operational
