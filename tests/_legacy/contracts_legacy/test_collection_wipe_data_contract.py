"""
Data integrity contract tests for `collection wipe`.

These tests guarantee that destructive wipes:
- delete only assets that belong to the targeted SourceCollection,
- leave other collections' assets alone,
- preserve shared assets,
- clean up dependent rows (ProviderRef, ReviewQueue),
- and do not leave dangling references.

See docs/contracts/CollectionWipe.md for the source of truth.
Behavior MUST NOT change without updating that contract first.
