# ✅ Known Limitations FIXED!

## Overview

Both known limitations from Phase 4 have been successfully addressed:

1. ✅ **FFprobe Unicode Errors** - FIXED
2. ✅ **UI Freeze During Sync** - FIXED

---

## 1. ✅ FFprobe Unicode Errors (FIXED)

### Problem

```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8d/0x81/0x8f in position X
File "...\subprocess.py", line 1597, in _readerthread
File "...\encodings\cp1252.py", line 23, in decode
```

Windows defaulted to cp1252 encoding for ffprobe subprocess output, which couldn't handle unicode characters in MKV container metadata.

### Solution

**File Modified**: `src/retrovue/plex/validation.py`

**Before**:

```python
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30)
```

**After**:

```python
# Use UTF-8 encoding with error replacement to handle unicode metadata
# This fixes Windows cp1252 encoding issues with MKV container metadata
result = subprocess.run(
    cmd,
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    encoding='utf-8',
    errors='replace',
    timeout=30
)
```

### Impact

- ✅ Files with unicode metadata no longer fail validation
- ✅ Sync operations complete without unicode errors
- ✅ More files successfully ingested into database

---

## 2. ✅ UI Freeze During Sync (FIXED)

### Problem

During "Sync (Write to DB)", the UI would freeze completely until the operation finished. This happened because `IngestOrchestrator.ingest_library()` was a blocking synchronous function that processed all items before returning.

**User Experience**:

- UI shows "Syncing..." message then freezes
- No progress updates during long operations
- Users couldn't see what was happening
- Had to watch console for real-time progress

### Solution

**Created New Streaming Method**: `IngestOrchestrator.ingest_library_stream()`

**Files Modified**:

- `src/retrovue/plex/ingest.py` - Added streaming generator method
- `src/retrovue/core/sync.py` - Updated to use streaming method

**Key Features**:

1. **Generator-Based**: Yields progress dictionaries as it processes
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Progress emitted every 10 items + after each batch
3. **Granular Reporting**: Multiple stages (start, library_ready, progress, batch_complete, complete)
4. **Error Reporting**: Yields error details inline with progress
5. **Backward Compatible**: Original `ingest_library()` still exists

**Progress Stages Yielded**:

- `start` - Sync initialization
- `library_ready` - Library info retrieved
- `progress` - Every 10 items scanned (configurable)
- `batch_complete` - After each batch commit
- `final_batch` - Last batch processed
- `complete` - Final summary with stats
- `error` / `fatal_error` - Error details

### Technical Implementation

**New Method Signature**:

```python
def ingest_library_stream(
    self,
    server: Dict[str, Any],
    library_key: int,
    kind: str,
    mode: str = 'full',
    since_epoch: Optional[int] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    dry_run: bool = False,
    verbose: bool = False,
    batch_size: int = 50,
    progress_interval: int = 10  # NEW: yield every N items
) -> Generator[Dict[str, Any], None, None]:
```

**Example Progress Dictionary**:

```python
{
    "stage": "progress",
    "msg": "Progress: 50 items scanned, 48 mapped",
    "stats": {
        "scanned": 50,
        "mapped": 48,
        "inserted_items": 35,
        "errors": 2
    },
    "item_title": "The Matrix"
}
```

### Impact

**Before**:

- ❌ UI completely frozen during sync
- ❌ No way to see progress
- ❌ Users unsure if application crashed
- ❌ Had to check console for updates

**After**:

- ✅ UI remains responsive
- ✅ Real-time progress updates in log area
- ✅ Users see item counts update live
- ✅ Clear indication of what's being processed
- ✅ Batch completion feedback
- ✅ Final summary with statistics

### Performance

- **Progress Interval**: Every 10 items (configurable)
- **Batch Size**: 50 items (configurable)
- **Overhead**: Minimal - just dict creation and yield
- **Responsiveness**: UI updates smoothly without lag

---

## Combined Benefits

With both limitations fixed:

1. **More Reliable Sync**:

   - Files with unicode metadata no longer fail
   - Better success rate on diverse media libraries

2. **Better User Experience**:

   - No more frozen UI
   - Real-time feedback on progress
   - Users can see sync is working

3. **Easier Debugging**:

   - Progress messages show what's being processed
   - Error messages appear inline with progress
   - Stats updated in real-time

4. **Production Ready**:
   - Handles edge cases (unicode, large libraries)
   - Responsive UI for long operations
   - Professional user experience

## Files Modified

| File                              | Lines Changed | Purpose                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `src/retrovue/plex/validation.py` | ~10           | Fix ffprobe encoding        |
| `src/retrovue/plex/ingest.py`     | +186          | Add streaming ingest method |
| `src/retrovue/core/sync.py`       | ~25           | Use streaming ingest        |

**Total**: 3 files, ~220 lines added/modified

---

## Testing

### FFprobe Fix Testing:

✅ Run sync on library with unicode metadata
✅ Verify no `UnicodeDecodeError` in console
✅ Verify files successfully validated
✅ Check sync completion stats

### UI Responsiveness Testing:

✅ Start sync operation
✅ Verify UI remains responsive (buttons, tabs work)
✅ Verify progress updates appear in log
✅ Verify batch completion messages
✅ Verify final stats appear
✅ Test with limit=10 for quick verification

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Original `ingest_library()` preserved** - CLI and other code continues to work
✅ **New `ingest_library_stream()` opt-in** - Only used by GUI  
✅ **API unchanged** - `SyncManager.run_sync()` signature unchanged  
✅ **GUI updated automatically** - Uses streaming via API

---

## Status: ✅ BOTH LIMITATIONS FIXED

The Plex import workflow is now:

- ✅ **Robust**: Handles unicode metadata
- ✅ **Responsive**: Real-time progress updates
- ✅ **Professional**: Production-quality UX

**No more workarounds needed!**
