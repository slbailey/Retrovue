AsRun Logger

Pattern: Observer + Data Recorder

The AsRunLogger is responsible for recording what actually aired on each channel,
providing accurate playout logs for reporting, compliance, and analytics.

Key Responsibilities:
- Record actual playout events as they happen
- Tag events with correct broadcast day labels
- Handle broadcast day rollover scenarios
- Provide accurate as-run data for reporting

Broadcast Day Behavior:
- AsRunLogger MUST call ScheduleService.broadcast_day_for(channel_id, when_utc) 
  for each playout event or subsegment.
- AsRunLogger is allowed to split a single continuous asset into multiple as-run 
  rows across a broadcast day boundary.
- Example: Movie 05:00–07:00 turns into:
  - Row A: 05:00–06:00 tagged broadcast_day=2025-10-24
  - Row B: 06:00–07:00 tagged broadcast_day=2025-10-25
- This is not an error. This is expected and correct.
- Document that in the AsRunLogger code comments so reporting later can pull 
  "everything that aired on 2025-10-24 broadcast day" and get the correct partial segment.
