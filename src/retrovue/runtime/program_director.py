Program Director

Pattern: Orchestrator + Policy Enforcer

The ProgramDirector is the global coordinator and policy layer for the entire broadcast system.
It orchestrates all channels, enforces system-wide policies, and manages emergency overrides.

Key Responsibilities:
- Coordinate all channels at a system level
- Enforce global policy and mode (normal vs emergency)
- Trigger system-wide emergency override and revert
- Report system health and status

Boundaries:
- ProgramDirector IS allowed to: Coordinate channels, enforce policies, manage emergencies
- ProgramDirector IS NOT allowed to: Generate schedules, ingest content, pick content, manage individual viewers, spawn Producer instances directly

Design Principles:
- Global coordination across all channels
- System-wide policy enforcement
- Emergency override capabilities
- Resource coordination and health monitoring
