Channel Manager

Pattern: Per-Channel Orchestrator

The ChannelManager is RetroVue's per-channel runtime controller. It's responsible for managing
live playback on ONE channel at a time, ensuring that the correct content is playing at the
right time with the proper timing offset.

ChannelManager is subordinate to ProgramDirector and must obey global mode (normal / emergency / guide).
It never invents content, never fixes schedule gaps, and never talks to the ingest pipeline.

ChannelManager is where "the channel goes on the air" â€” it is the board operator for that channel.

Key Responsibilities:
- Ask ScheduleService (Schedule Manager) what should be airing "right now" for this channel
- Use MasterClock to compute the correct offset into the current program
- Resolve the playout plan and hand it to a Producer
- Ensure the correct Producer is active for the current mode
- Track active viewer sessions and apply the fanout model
- Report health/status up to ProgramDirector

Boundaries:
- ChannelManager IS allowed to: Read schedules, manage producers, handle viewers, apply channel policies
- ChannelManager IS NOT allowed to: Write schedules, pick content, make scheduling decisions, bypass Schedule Manager
- ChannelManager is not allowed to ask Content Manager or Schedule Manager for 'new content' on demand
- If something is missing from the schedule, that's considered a scheduling failure upstream, not permission to improvise

    ChannelManager is the per-channel board operator. It runs the fanout model. It is the only

    It consumes the schedule but does not write it. It never chooses content; it only plays

    - Swap Producers when ProgramDirector changes global mode (normal/emergency/guide)
    - Expose the Producer's stream endpoint so viewers can attach
    - Surface health/status upward to ProgramDirector

    Hard boundaries:
    - ChannelManager does NOT pick content
    - ChannelManager does NOT modify schedule
    - ChannelManager does NOT call ffmpeg or manage OS processes directly
    - ChannelManager does NOT "fill gaps" if schedule is missing
