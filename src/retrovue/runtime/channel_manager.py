Channel Manager

Pattern: Per-Channel Orchestrator

The ChannelManager is a per-channel runtime controller that manages individual channel
operations. It coordinates with Schedule Manager for programming, controls Producer
lifecycle, and handles channel-specific policies.

Key Responsibilities:
- Manage channel runtime and ensure continuous operation
- Coordinate with Schedule Manager for current programming
- Control Producer lifecycle based on viewer demand
- Handle channel-specific policies and restrictions
- Monitor channel health and performance

Boundaries:
- ChannelManager IS allowed to: Read schedules, manage producers, handle viewers, apply channel policies
- ChannelManager IS NOT allowed to: Write schedules, pick content, make scheduling decisions, bypass Schedule Manager

Design Principles:
- Per-channel coordination and control
- Viewer-driven resource management
- Schedule-based content coordination
- Channel-specific policy enforcement

    Per-channel runtime controller that manages individual channel operations.
    
    Pattern: Per-Channel Orchestrator
    
    This manages a single channel's runtime operations, coordinating with Schedule Manager
    for programming, controlling Producer lifecycle, and handling channel-specific policies.
    It never makes scheduling decisions or picks contentâ€”it only coordinates runtime operations.
    
    Key Responsibilities:
    - Ask ScheduleService (Schedule Manager) what should be airing 'right now', using MasterClock to compute the correct offset into the current program
    - Instantiate or reuse a Producer that implements the Producer Protocol
    - Track viewer count and apply the fanout model (first viewer starts Producer, last viewer stops it)
    - ChannelManager must never write schedule data, mutate horizons, or pick content assets directly. It only consumes schedule output and enforces lifecycle.
    
    Boundaries:
    - IS allowed to: Read schedules, manage producers, handle viewers, apply channel policies
    - IS NOT allowed to: Write schedules, pick content, make scheduling decisions, bypass Schedule Manager
    - ChannelManager is not allowed to ask Content Manager or Schedule Manager for 'new content' on demand. If something is missing from the schedule, that's considered a scheduling failure upstream, not permission to improvise.
