Schedule Service

Pattern: Authority

The ScheduleService is the single source of truth for all schedule state in RetroVue.
It owns the EPG Horizon and Playlog Horizon data, and is the only interface allowed
to create or modify schedule entries.

Key Responsibilities:
- Maintain EPG Horizon (≥ 2 days ahead)
- Maintain Playlog Horizon (≥ 2 hours ahead) 
- Enforce block rules and content policies
- Provide read methods for current and future programming
- Ensure time alignment across all channels

Authority Rule:
ScheduleService is the single authority over EPGEntry, PlaylogEvent, and schedule state.
No other part of the system may write or mutate these records directly.
All schedule generation, updates, corrections, and horizon management must go through ScheduleService.
The rest of the system must not write schedule data directly or silently patch horizons. All modifications go through ScheduleService inside a Unit of Work.

Design Principles:
- All operations are atomic (Unit of Work)
- EPG entries are snapped to :00/:30 boundaries
- Playlog events have precise absolute_start/absolute_end timestamps
- Schedule state is always consistent and valid
