Schedule Rules and Policies

This file encodes policy, not IO.

This module defines the content rules and policies that govern scheduling
decisions in RetroVue. It includes block rules, tone restrictions, rotation
rules, and other content policies.

Key Components:
- BlockRule: Time-based content restrictions
- BlockPolicy: Collections of rules with priorities
- RotationRule: Content repetition and spacing rules

Design Principles:
- Rules are declarative, not procedural
- Policies can be combined and prioritized
- Rules are channel-specific and time-aware
- Content decisions are deterministic and auditable
