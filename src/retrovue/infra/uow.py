"""
This is the canonical Unit of Work boundary for RetroVue. All transactional changes must go through this.

Do not open ad hoc sessions elsewhere.

This module provides the single source of truth for database session management across
the entire RetroVue system, ensuring consistent transaction semantics for both CLI
operations and API requests.

    Database session context manager for CLI operations and batch jobs.
