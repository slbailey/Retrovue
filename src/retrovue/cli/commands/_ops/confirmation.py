"""
Confirmation module for destructive operations.

This module implements interactive destructive confirmation logic as defined by
docs/contracts/_ops/DestructiveOperationConfirmation.md (C-1 through C-14).

The module provides:
- A lightweight data structure that summarizes the impact of a pending destructive operation
- Functions to build human-facing confirmation prompt text
- Functions to evaluate confirmation and return a decision

This module is designed to be testable without mocking stdin/stdout.
The CLI wrapper will handle IO; tests will call these helpers directly.
