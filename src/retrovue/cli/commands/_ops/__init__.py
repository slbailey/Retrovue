Operations package for destructive CLI commands.

This package contains contract-driven helper modules for destructive commands
that implement standardized confirmation and safety logic.

Modules:
- confirmation: Interactive destructive confirmation logic (C-1 through C-14)
- source_delete_ops: Source deletion operations (B-4 through B-8, D-1 through D-10)
