# ‚úÖ Phase 7 Complete: Quality & Parity Checks

## Overview

Phase 7 focused on improving quality, adding missing features, and making the modular Qt GUI production-ready. This phase significantly improved the user experience and fixed critical missing functionality.

---

## üéØ Improvements Delivered

### 1. ‚úÖ Path Mapping Deletion (Feature Addition)

**Before**: Delete button showed "Not Implemented" error message.

**After**: Fully functional deletion with confirmation dialog.

**Impact**: Users can now manage their path mappings completely within the GUI.

**Technical Changes**:

- Updated `Db.get_path_mappings()` to return dictionaries with IDs
- Modified return types throughout the stack (Sync ‚Üí API)
- Implemented delete handler with confirmation in GUI
- 4 files modified

---

### 2. ‚úÖ API Usage Consistency (Bug Fix)

**Before**: One reference used `self.sync_manager` directly instead of `self.api`.

**After**: Consistent API usage throughout all GUI code.

**Impact**: Ensures all operations go through the unified API layer (Phase 5 architecture).

**Technical Changes**:

- Changed `_start_sync()` to use `self.api.list_path_mappings()`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Sync Limit Feature (Bug Fix)

**Before**: Limit spinbox was displayed but value was ignored.

**After**: Limit value is properly extracted and used during sync.

**Impact**: Users can test sync with small datasets (e.g., "limit: 10") before running full syncs.

**Technical Changes**:

- Extract limit from `self.sync_limit_spinbox`
- Pass to `api.sync_content()`
- Display in log message for transparency

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Comprehensive Tooltips (UX Improvement)

**Before**: No tooltips - users had to guess what fields meant.

**After**: 15+ helpful tooltips throughout the GUI.

**Impact**: Self-documenting interface - users get context on hover.

**Tooltips Added**:

**Servers Tab**:

- Name: "Friendly name to identify this server"
- URL: "Base URL of your Plex server (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:32400)"
- Token: "Plex authentication token (get from Plex settings)"
- Add: "Add this Plex server to the database"
- Refresh: "Reload the server list from database"
- Delete: "Delete the selected server from database"

**Libraries Tab**:

- Server dropdown: "Select a Plex server to discover its libraries"
- Discover: "Connect to the selected server and discover all available libraries"
- Refresh: "Reload libraries list from database"

**Content Sync Tab**:

- Server: "Select which Plex server to sync content from"
- Library: "Select which library to sync (must have sync enabled)"
- Plex Path: "Path prefix as seen by Plex server (e.g., /mnt/media/movies)"
- Local Path: "Corresponding local path on this machine (e.g., D:\\Movies)"
- Add Mapping: "Add this path mapping to the database"
- Dry Run: "Preview sync without writing to database - safe to test"
- Sync: "Sync content and write to database - this will modify data"

---

### 5. ‚úÖ README Documentation (Documentation)

**Before**: README had no GUI documentation.

**After**: Comprehensive GUI section with setup instructions.

**Additions**:

- "Launch the GUI (Recommended)" section
- Feature list with emojis
- Step-by-step first-time setup guide
- Platform-specific launch instructions

---

## üìä Statistics

### Files Modified

- `src/retrovue/plex/db.py` - Return IDs with mappings
- `src/retrovue/core/sync.py` - Update return type
- `src/retrovue/core/api.py` - Update signature/docstrings
- `src/retrovue/gui/features/importers/page.py` - 4 improvements, 15+ tooltips
- `Readme.md` - Add GUI documentation

**Total**: 5 files, ~50 lines added/modified

### Quality Metrics

- ‚úÖ 0 linter errors
- ‚úÖ 0 import errors
- ‚úÖ GUI launches successfully
- ‚úÖ All features functional

## üß™ Testing Status

### Manual Testing Performed:

- ‚úÖ GUI launches without errors
- ‚úÖ Path mapping deletion works with confirmation
- ‚úÖ Sync limit is applied correctly
- ‚úÖ Tooltips appear on hover
- ‚úÖ All workflows complete end-to-end

### Known Limitations (Documented):

1. **UI Freeze During Sync** (Phase 4 issue)

   - `IngestOrchestrator` is synchronous
   - Workaround: Console shows real-time progress
   - Future: Refactor to async/generator (documented in MIGRATION_NOTES.md)

2. **FFprobe Unicode Errors** (Pre-existing bug)
   - Windows cp1252 encoding issues
   - Affected files are skipped, sync continues
   - Future: Fix subprocess encoding in `validation.py` (documented in MIGRATION_NOTES.md)

---

## üìö Documentation Updates

### Files Updated:

- `Readme.md` - GUI quick start and features
- `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - Phase 6 & 7 completion (already updated)
- `PHASE_7_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Detailed improvement tracking
- `PHASE_7_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

### Documentation Quality:

- ‚úÖ User-facing: README has clear setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Developer-facing: MIGRATION_NOTES tracks architecture changes
- ‚úÖ Detailed: All improvements documented with rationale
- ‚úÖ Future-proof: Known limitations documented for future phases
