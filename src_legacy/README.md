# src_legacy Policy

- This directory quarantines legacy modules that do not follow the current contract + noun-verb methodology.
- Do not add new code here.
- If you must reference something here temporarily, prefer copying only the minimal logic and refactoring it to the new architecture.
- Any imports from `src_legacy` should be treated as transitional and removed before merging to main.
