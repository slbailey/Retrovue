Schedule Orchestrator

Pattern: Orchestrator

The ScheduleOrchestrator coordinates the complex process of maintaining schedule
horizons and ensuring continuous programming. It rolls horizons forward, applies
content rules, and guarantees coverage invariants.

Key Responsibilities:
- Roll horizons forward as time progresses
- Apply block rules and tone rules
- Pull canonical assets from Content Manager (never from filesystem)
- Write via ScheduleService under a Unit of Work
- Guarantee coverage invariants (EPG ≥ 2 days, Playlog ≥ 2 hours)

Design Principles:
- Never bypasses Content Manager for content discovery
- All schedule modifications go through ScheduleService
- Operations are atomic and consistent
- Maintains schedule continuity across time boundaries
